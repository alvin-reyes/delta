## Features
- Make e2e / online and import / offline storage deals.
- Compute piece_commitments using variety of methods
  - boost piece commitment computation
  - fast piece commitment computation
  - filclient piece commitment computation
- Assign deals to specific miners
- Assign deals to specific wallets
- Shows all the deals made for specific user
- Extensive status information about the deals made
- Support for multiple wallets
- Lightweight. Uses a light ipfs node `whypfs-core` to stage the files.
